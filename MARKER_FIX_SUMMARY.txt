MARKER RENDERING ISSUE - CRITICAL FINDINGS
===========================================

CURRENT STATUS: MARKERS STILL NOT RENDERING
------------------------------------------
Latest build with all KSP fixes still shows NO markers.

CRITICAL DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE:
-----------------------------
✅ Map tiles render (Google Maps works)
✅ React components render (3 markers logged in console)
✅ MapView ref exists
❌ onMapReady callback NEVER fires <- THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN

What onMapReady not firing means:
- The native Google MapView is NOT completing initialization
- The bridge between React Native and native MapView is broken
- Markers can't render because the native map view isn't ready

FIXES ALREADY APPLIED (didn't solve it):
---------------------------------------
1. ✅ KSP version corrected to 2.0.21-1.0.28 in ALL files
2. ✅ eas.json updated with correct KSP version
3. ✅ Marker props optimized (tracksViewChanges={false})
4. ✅ Simplified marker implementation
5. ✅ Google Maps API key verified in app.json

THE REAL PROBLEM:
-----------------
This is NOT a KSP version issue (that's fixed).
This is NOT a marker configuration issue.
This IS a native Google MapView initialization failure.

Possible causes:
1. R8/ProGuard is stripping required MapView classes in release builds
2. Google Play Services isn't properly configured
3. react-native-maps native module isn't properly linked
4. There's a compatibility issue with react-native-maps 1.26.0 + RN 0.79.4

RECOMMENDED FIX:
----------------
The issue is likely R8 full mode (enabled in gradle.properties) is
stripping classes needed for MapView initialization.

Solution: Add ProGuard rules OR disable R8 full mode for testing.

Current gradle.properties has:
android.enableR8.fullMode=true

This aggressive optimization can break react-native-maps.
