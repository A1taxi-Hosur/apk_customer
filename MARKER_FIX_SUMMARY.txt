REACT-NATIVE-MAPS MARKER FIX - ROOT CAUSE
===========================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Markers not rendering on Google Maps
- Map tiles loading correctly
- Driver app shows markers, customer app doesn't

ROOT CAUSE:
- KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) version MISMATCH
- Project was using: KSP 2.0.21-1.0.27
- Expo expects:      KSP 2.0.21-1.0.28
- This causes native modules (including react-native-maps) to compile incorrectly
- Markers fail to render because the native marker module doesn't link properly

ORIGINAL ERROR:
"Key 1.9.24 is missing in the map"
- React Native 0.79.4 uses Kotlin 1.9.24
- Expo SDK 53 expects Kotlin 2.0.21
- ExpoModulesCorePlugin.gradle has mapping: "2.0.21": "2.0.21-1.0.28"

FIXES APPLIED:
1. gradle.properties: Changed KSP_VERSION from 2.0.21-1.0.27 to 2.0.21-1.0.28
2. eas-build-pre-install.sh: Updated KSP_VERSION export
3. eas-build-post-install.sh: Updated forced KSP_VERSION
4. SimpleHosurMap.tsx: Added proper marker props (key, identifier, pinColor)

TEST MAP IMPROVEMENTS:
- Added 3 test markers at different locations
- Added key/identifier props for proper React Native tracking
- Added pinColor for visual debugging (red, green, blue)
- Added flat={false} to ensure 3D rendering
- Added explicit zIndex values
- Added red overlay to confirm component renders

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run: EAS_NO_VCS=1 npx eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache
2. Install APK and check logs for: "ðŸ§ªðŸ§ªðŸ§ª TEST MAP"
3. You should see 3 colored markers on the map
4. If markers appear, the KSP version fix worked

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- KSP version mismatch causes SILENT native module failures
- react-native-maps compiles but markers don't render
- This is why map tiles work but markers don't
- This is a known issue with Expo SDK 53 + React Native 0.79.x
