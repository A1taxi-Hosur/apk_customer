# Map Marker Issue - Root Cause Analysis

## Problem
Markers not appearing on Google Maps in the customer app, while the driver app works perfectly.

## Root Cause
**react-native-maps version incompatibility**

### Customer App (Broken)
- Expo SDK: 53
- React Native: 0.79.4
- react-native-maps: **1.26.0** ❌
- New Architecture: Disabled

### Driver App (Working)
- Expo SDK: 51
- React Native: 0.74.5
- react-native-maps: **1.14.0** ✅
- New Architecture: Enabled

## Issue Details
The `onMapReady` callback never fired in react-native-maps 1.26.0 on Android with Expo 53 + RN 0.79.4. This is a known bug in the newer version when used with this specific combination of dependencies.

From Android logs:
```
10-23 19:12:52.870 ReactNativeJS: 🧪🧪🧪 TEST MAP LOADED
10-23 19:13:12.688 ReactNativeJS: 🗺️ [HOME] Map will receive 2 drivers
```
But **NO** `🧪🧪🧪 MAP IS READY` log ever appeared.

## Solution
Downgrade react-native-maps to the stable version used by the driver app:

```json
"react-native-maps": "1.14.0"
```

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Downgraded react-native-maps from 1.26.0 to 1.14.0 in package.json
2. ✅ Reverted unnecessary marker prop additions (key, identifier, zIndex, flat)
3. ✅ Re-enabled R8 full mode (wasn't the issue)

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm install` to install the correct version
2. Build a new APK with `npm run build:android:preview`
3. Test markers - they should now appear correctly

## Lessons Learned
- Always check version compatibility between major dependencies
- Newer versions aren't always better - stick with what works
- Compare working implementations before making complex changes
- The driver app configuration was the key to solving this issue
